# bypass - elusive

A quick 4kb WebGPU intro for Deadline 2023. We did not want to show up empty handed after roughly 17 years of abscence from the demoscene.

supah - audio shader

warp - visual shader, intro code

## Run info

Final release can be found in the /release directory. You will need a WebGPU-capable browser, like Chromium/Chrome (version 113 or higher), Firefox Nightly or Edge. Please use the '--allow-file-access-from-files' option for Chrome or start a local webserver (python3 -m http.server) in the intro directory to run. 

## Build info

You will need the following tools to package and compress the input files (javascript and shader).
